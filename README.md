In this app, the person can roam around the room (like the VRChat), can grab several objects in the scene with the controller, and while grabbing the fingers will pose like the shape of the object (to make it look like natural grabbing). There is no scoring level in the scene, this object grabbing & player movement can be integrated within immersive Metaverse games. It has been built with the Oculus Interaction SDK, and can be run on Oculus Quest devices. With the hand-tracking feature the hand pose detection has been implemented, which can be used to control objects in the scene without using the controller.
